# i3Digit OS

i3Digit OS is a powerful application designed to streamline various aspects of managing 3D printing and modeling services. It simplifies the process of handling materials, pricing, and database management, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

**About i3Digit**

At i3Digit, we specialize in 3D printing and modeling services, dealing with a vast array of materials essential for the printing process. With numerous filament types available, each with its unique price and weight, manually calculating costs becomes labor-intensive. i3Digit OS resolves this challenge by providing a suite of user-friendly functions, significantly reducing time spent on routine calculations. By storing all material information in a MySQL database, users can effortlessly access data without the need for repetitive manual inputs of material details.

**Key Functions & Roadmap**

i3Digit OS offers three primary functions which is divided into development phases:

- **PHASE 1 - PRESENT VERSION** - Data Management: Easily write, read, and delete filament data within the database. Simplify the handling of various materials used in 3D printing.

- PHASE 2 - Price Calculation: Seamlessly calculate the end price of 3D printed products based on user selections. Efficiently manage cost estimations and optimize pricing strategies.

- PHASE 3 - Printer Integration: The application features a dedicated Printer tab, aiming to streamline the integration of different 3D printers. Each printer can be configured individually, catering to their unique functionalities.
